# speakerSelect
Use Arduino to select speaker sets, input devices, volume on a local network
Hardware needed: Arduino Mega board, Wifi attached board, Two 8-relay sainsmart boards, 1 programmable remote control, 1 stereo receiver, 4 sets of speakers.
Software allows choice of 1 to 4 sets of speakers to turn on/off, a choice of 3 audio inputs, and a method to turn volume up and down.  The audio input and
volume selection is done by a hacked infrared remote control, which by means of relays, flashes the infrared pick up in the stereo receiver.  Works great.
